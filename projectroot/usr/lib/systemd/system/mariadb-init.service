# MariaDB run-time preparation
#
# Preparation must be run once if the "data" (=working directory) does not
# exist yet.
# Since we expect a read-only root filesystem, we need one writeable filesystem
# part at "/var/lib/mysql".
#
# Since we change some permissions, the script itself must run as user 'root'
