	  The X Composite extension adds support for translucent windows and
	  non-rectangular windows with anti-aliased edges to the X window system.
	  It also makes the content of obscured windows available to for example
	  desktop pagers, and provides backing store which eliminates flicker. It also
	  makes it possible for a composition manager to draw dynamic effects on the
	  screen, such as window drop shadows.
