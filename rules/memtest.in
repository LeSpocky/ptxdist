	  Juan Quintela's Memory Test Suite

	  This is one (small) test suite of programs that have triggered/trigger
	  problems in the virtual memory system.  The idea is having a set of
	  programs easy to set up and run to test the memory system.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2026.11.0
	  Seems to be obsolete and upstream long dead and gone.
