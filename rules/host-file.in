	  The file command is "a file type guesser", that is, a command-line tool
	  that tells you in words what kind of data a file contains. Unlike most
	  GUI systems, command-line UNIX systems - with this program leading the
	  charge - don't rely on filename extensions to tell you the type of a
	  file, but look at the file's actual contents. This is, of course, more
	  reliable, but requires a bit of I/O.
