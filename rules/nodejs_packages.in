config NODEJS_PACKAGES_LIST
	string
	prompt "Node.js packages to install"
	help
	  A white-space separated list of Node.js packages including their
	  versions (e.g. express@4.17.x or socket.io@'>=2.1.0 <=2.3.0'). NPM
	  semvers are fully supported, see [1].

	  The packages are managed with Yarn and are guaranteed to be
	  reproducible and immutable as long as the download location stays
	  accessible or the offline cache is not altered.

	  If the list of Node.js packages to be installed has been populated for
	  the first time or if it has been modified later on one needs to
	  (re-)build this package to download the desired Node.js packages and
	  update the offline cache. Afterwards it is highly recommended to
	  commit the path '${PTXDIST_WORKSPACE}/local_src/nodejs_packages/' into
	  the version control system and to lock the package cache.

	  As a prerequisite the path '${PTXDIST_WORKSPACE}/local_src/nodejs_
	  packages/' must exist in the BSP *before* building this package.

config NODEJS_PACKAGES_LICENSE
	string
	prompt "Licenses of to be installed Node.js packages"
	default "unknown"
	help
	  Manually compiled list of licenses that the to be installed Node.js
	  packages are distributed under, see description of the variable
	  *_LICENSE in [1].

	  ATTENTION: be aware of the fact that Node.js packages usually depend
	  on additional Node.js packages that Yarn installs as well and that
	  this propagates recursively resulting in an unknown number of Node.js
	  packages on the target with an unknown set of licenses that they may
	  be utilized under. Hence you carefully need to examine all of them
	  individually to create a reliable list of licenses.

config NODEJS_PACKAGES_OFFLINE
	bool
	prompt "Lock offline cache for offline/production use"
	help
	  This option locks the offline cache for installing the Node.js
	  packages and allows their installation during the build of the BSP
	  without any need for internet connectivity.

	  Enabling this option is highly recommended for production use.

	  Do NOT forget to commit the path '${PTXDIST_WORKSPACE}/local_src/
	  nodejs_packages/' into the BSP's version control system!
