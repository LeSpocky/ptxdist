	  Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a
	  number of utilities with enhanced security functionality
	  designed to add mandatory access controls to Linux. The
	  Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new architectural
	  components originally developed to improve the security of
	  the Flask operating system. These architectural components
	  provide general support for the enforcement of many kinds of
	  mandatory access control policies, including those based on
	  the concepts of Type Enforcement, Role-based Access Control,
	  and Multi-level Security.

	  This package contains checkpolicy, the SELinux policy
	  compiler. Only required for building policies. It uses
	  libsepol to generate the binary policy. checkpolicy uses
	  the static libsepol since it deals with low level details of
	  the policy that have not been encapsulated/abstracted by a
	  proper shared library interface.

	  STAGING: remove in ptxdist-2020.12.0
	  Old version that need to be updated. Moved to staging with libselinux.
