	  Hard drive bottleneck testing benchmark suite

	  It is called Bonnie++ because it was based on the Bonnie program.
	  This program also tests performance by creating large numbers
	  of files.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2023.04.0
	  Not realy maintained in PTXdist and fails to build with a current
	  toolchain (gcc 11).
