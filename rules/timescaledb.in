	  TimescaleDB is an open-source database designed to make SQL scalable
	  for time-series data.  It is engineered up from PostgreSQL, providing
	  automatic partitioning across time and space (partitioning key), as
	  well as full SQL support.

	  This package builds the Apache licensed PostgreSQL extension, only.
