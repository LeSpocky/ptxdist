	  Sodium is a new, easy-to-use software library for encryption,
	  decryption, signatures, password hashing and more.
	  It is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of
	  NaCl, with a compatible API, and an extended API to improve usability
	  even further. Its goal is to provide all of the core operations
	  needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.
