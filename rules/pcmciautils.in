	  PCMCIAutils contains hotplug scripts and initialization tools
	  necessary to allow the PCMCIA subsystem to behave (almost) as
	  every other hotpluggable bus system (e.g. USB, IEEE1394).
	  Please note that the kernel support for this new feature is only
	  present since 2.6.13-rc1. Also, you need sysfsutils 1.3.0 and
	  module-init-tools 3.2-pre4 or later.
	  (see http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/pcmcia/pcmcia.html
	   and http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/pcmcia/howto.html)

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2026.03.0
	  Unmaintained in PTXdist, upstream dead and fails to build with
	  current toolchains.

	  If this is enabled some more programs are built and installed to allow
	  hotplugging of the pcmcia socket itself.
	  "You don't need it if the socket driver does not select
	  PCCARD_NONSTATIC -- that is the case for many embedded systems --
	  and for yenta_socket if the cardbus bridge is either below a
	  PCI-PCI bridge, or where the PCI bus is not equivalent to the host
	  bus (e.g. on PPC)"
