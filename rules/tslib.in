	  Tslib is an abstraction layer for touchscreen panel events,
	  as well as a filter stack for the manipulation of those
	  events. It was created by Russell King of arm.linux.org.uk.
	  Examples of implemented filters include jitter smoothing
	  and the calibration transform. Tslib is generally used on
	  embedded devices to provide a common user space interface
	  to touchscreen functionality.
