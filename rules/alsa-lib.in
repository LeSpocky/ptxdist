		  SALSA-Lib is a small, light-weight, hot and spicy version of
		  the ALSA library, mainly for embedded systems with limited
		  resources. The library is designed to be source-level
		  compatible with ALSA library API for limited contents.  Most
		  of function calls are inlined, and accesses directly to the
		  hardware via system calls.
		  Some components like ALSA sequencer aren't supported, and
		  most of all, the alsa-lib plugins and configurations are
		  completely dropped.  Thus, neither dmix nor format
		  conversion is available with SALSA-lib.
