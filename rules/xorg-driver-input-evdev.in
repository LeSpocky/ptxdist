	  evdev is an Xorg input driver for Linux's generic
	  event devices.  It therefore supports all input
	  devices that the kernel knows about, including
	  most mice and keyboards.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2023.12.0
	  Not really maintained any more in PTXdist. Moved with the xorg server.
	  The whole Xorg ecosystem needs updating and cleanup.
