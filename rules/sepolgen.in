	  A Python module used in SELinux policy generation

	  This package contains a Python module that forms the core of
	  the modern audit2allow (which is a part of the package
	  policycoreutils). The sepolgen library is structured to give
	  flexibility to the application using it. The library
	  contains: Reference Policy Representation, which are Objects
	  for representing policies and the reference policy
	  interfaces. Secondly, it has objects and algorithms for
	  representing access and sets of access in an abstract way
	  and searching that access. It also has a parser for
	  reference policy "headers". It contains infrastructure for
	  parsing SELinux related messages as produced by the audit
	  system. It has facilities for generating policy based on
	  required access.

	  STAGING: remove in ptxdist-2020.06.0
	  Old version that needs to be updated.
