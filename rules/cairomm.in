	  cairomm is a C++ wrapper for the cairo graphics library. It offers all
	  the power of cairo with an interface familiar to C++ developers,
	  including use of the Standard Template Library where it makes sense.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2025.07.0
	  Unmaintained in ptxdist and dependency libsigc++ fails to build with gcc 14.
	  Needs updating to a new version.
