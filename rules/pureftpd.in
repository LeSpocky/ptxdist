	  FTP server based upon Troll-FTPd. Features include chrooted
	  home directories, virtual domains, built-in 'ls', anti-warez
	  system, configurable ports for passive downloads, FXP protocol,
	  bandwidth throttling, ratios, fortune files, Apache-like log
	  files, fast standalone mode, atomic uploads, text / HTML /
	  XML real-time status report, virtual users, virtual quotas,
 	  privilege separation, SSL/TLS and more.

	  start, because the -o switch to the server is set when this
	  option is enabled.

	help
	  To efficiently use features of modern FTP clients, Pure-FTPd implements
	  the basics of the FTP protocol, with many extensions (SITE IDLE,
	  SITE CHMOD, MLSD, ...) . Using this switch, these extensions won't be
	  compiled in. Also, there will be no standalone server, no lookup for
	  user/group names, no humor and no ASCII support. But the executable
	  file size will be smaller than in a default installation. Regular
	  expressions are still working.

# FIXME: Check if this is true: pure-ftpd cannot be started standalone when a minimal
# server was built. Seems not yet. If yes, disable standalone script, when a minimal
# server was built!

config PUREFTPD_SHRINK_MORE

	help
	  If you still want to reduce the size, use also this switch and don't
	  include the globbing code. It reduces the memory footprint but regular
	  expressions won't work any more (things like 'ls *.rpm').
	  But note: Globbing is a nice feature and for Windows clients most of
	  time required!
