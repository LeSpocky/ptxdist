	  CRDA acts as the udev helper for communication between the kernel and
	  userspace for regulatory compliance. It relies on nl80211 for communication.
	  CRDA is intended to be run only through udev communication from the kernel.
	  The user should never have to run it manually except if debugging udev issues.

	prompt "Install only regulatory db"
	help
	  CRDA is a legacy option for kernels older than 4.15.
	  Newer kernels can use the regulatory db as a firmware file,
	  without external help.
	  If enabled, the CRDA package only installs the regulatory.db file.
