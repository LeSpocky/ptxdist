	  The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the
	  administration of log files on a system which generates a lot
	  of log files. Logrotate allows for the automatic rotation
	  compression, removal and mailing of log files. Logrotate can
	  be set to handle a log file daily, weekly, monthly or when the
	  log file gets to a certain size. Normally, logrotate runs as
	  a daily cron job.

	  Note: on a read-only root filesystem this package still requires a
	  writable '/var/lib' for its run-time information.
