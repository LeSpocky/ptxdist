	  a generic Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) parsing and
	  manipulation toolkit

	  Services provided by Libcroco:

	  * A parser module that provides o A SAC like api. SAC stands
            for Simple Api for CSS. SAC is an event driven api which
            resembles SAX in the xml world.

	  * A CSSOM like api. CSSOM stands for Cascading Style Sheet
            Object Model.

	    The libcroco parser implements the CSS Level 2
	    specification, the CSS forward compatibility rules and the
	    CSS cascading rules.

	  * A CSS2 selection engine Given an xml element node (that
            obviously comes from an xml document) and a stylesheet
            cascade, the Libcroco selection engine can evaluate the
            css selectors of the cascade and return the style
            properties associated to the xml element node.

	  Note that the xml manipulation toolkit used by the libcroco
	    selection engine at the moment is libxml2.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2021.05.0

	  Old version that needs to be updated, and license is unclear
	  (headers say LGPL-2.1-or-later, COPYING contains LGPL-2.0)
