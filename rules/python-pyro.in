	  Pyro is a library that enables you to build applications
	  in which objects can talk to each other over the network,
	  with minimal programming effort. You can just use normal
	  Python method calls, with almost every possible parameter
	  and return value type, and Pyro takes care of locating the
	  right object on the right computer to execute the method.
	  It is designed to be very easy to use, and to generally stay
	  out of your way. But it also provides a set of powerful features
	  that enables you to build distributed applications rapidly and
	  effortlessly. Pyro is written in 100% pure Python and therefore
	  runs on many platforms and Python versions, including Python 3.x
