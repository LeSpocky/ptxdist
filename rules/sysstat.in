	  sar, iostat and mpstat - system performance tools for Linux

	  The sysstat package contains the following system
	  performance tools:

	  * sar - collects and reports system activity information;
	  * iostat - reports CPU utilization and I/O statistics for disks;
	  * mpstat - reports global and per-processor statistics;
	  * pidstat - reports statistics for Linux tasks (processes);
	  * sadf - displays data collected by sar in various formats.

	  The statistics reported by sar concern I/O transfer rates,
	  paging activity, process-related activities, interrupts,
	  network activity, memory and swap space utilization, CPU
	  utilization, kernel activities and TTY statistics, among
	  others. Both UP and SMP machines are fully supported.

	  Note: on a read-only root filesystem this package still requires a
	  writable '/var/log'.
