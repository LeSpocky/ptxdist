	  zstd is a fast lossless compression algorithm and data
	  compression tool, with command line syntax similar to
	  gzip and xz. It is based on the LZ77 family, with further
	  FSE & huff0 entropy stages. zstd offers highly configurable
	  compression speed, with fast modes at > 200 MB/s per code,
	  and strong modes nearing lzma compression ratios. It also
	  features a very fast decoder, with speeds > 500 MB/s per core.
