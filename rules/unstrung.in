	  Unstrung is an implementation of the IETF ROLL Working Group's RPL
	  RFC6550 routing protocol. RPL is pronounced Ripple. RPL is an IETF
	  protocol that provides connectivity among nodes that can not all
	  hear each other, but rather have to form a multihop mesh-like
	  network.

	  STAGING: remove in ptxdist-2021.05.0
	  Upstream seems to be mostly dead. Fails to build with gcc >= 9.x.
