	  Measures the available bandwidth on ARM based CPUs into the external
	  RAM. It can help to check chipset and RAM timing settings.
	  Note: it does not work on a different architecture than ARM and it
	  needs at least an ARMv5 core!

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2026.10.0
	  Seems to be obsolete and upstream long dead and gone.
