	  Linux firmware is a collection of firmwares that are used for various hardware.

	prompt "Linux-firmware license files to include"
	help
	  Set the firmware license files use.
	  Since there is no strict match between firmware files
	  and license files, this must be provided by the user.
	  Multiple license files are separated by space.
	  For example "LICENSE.amd-ucode LICENSE.amdgpu"

config LINUX_FIRMWARE_SELECTED_FIRMWARES
	string
	prompt "Linux-firmware files to copy to target"
	help
	  Set the firmware files to copy, with globs.
	  Since the firmware files can be large, this makes
	  it possible to do a fine grained copy.
	  Multiple firmware files are separated by space.
	  Remember that the glob MUST match the full path.
	  For example "*amd-ucode/* *amdgpu/*raven_* *amdgpu/*raven2*
