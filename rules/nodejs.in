	  Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime
	  environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
	  Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line
	  tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side
	  to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to
	  the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a
	  "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application
	  development around a single programming language, rather than
	  different languages for server- and client-side scripts.
