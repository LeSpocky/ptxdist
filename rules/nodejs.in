	  evented I/O for V8 javascript

	  Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime
	  for easily building fast, scalable network
	  applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O
	  model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for
	  data-intensive real-time applications that run across
	  distributed devices.

	  STAGING: remove in ptxdist-2020.06.0
	  Old version that need to be updated. Fails to build with gcc >= 7.x.
