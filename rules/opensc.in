	  Smart card utilities with support for PKCS#15 compatible cards

	  OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to access
	  smart cards. It mainly focuses on cards that support
	  cryptographic operations. It facilitates their use in
	  security applications such as mail encryption,
	  authentication, and digital signature. OpenSC implements the
	  PKCS#11 API.
