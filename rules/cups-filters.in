	  cups-filters contains backends, filters, and other software that
	  was once part of the core CUPS distribution but is no longer
	  maintained by Apple Inc. In addition it contains additional filters
	  and software developed independently of Apple, especially filters for
	  the PDF-centric printing workflow introduced by OpenPrinting and a
	  daemon to browse Bonjour broadcasts of remote CUPS printers and makes
	  these printers available locally.
