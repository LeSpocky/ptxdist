	  easy-rsa is a CLI utility to build and manage a PKI CA. In laymen's
	  terms, this means to create a root certificate authority, and request
	  and sign certificates, including sub-CAs and certificate revokation
	  lists (CRL). This is for people which don't know how to generate
	  all PKI files with openssl tool. Additional this is for people which
	  have a enough less paranoia to generate keys on an embedded device.
	  The easy-rsa scripts will be placed at /usr/share/easy-rsa afterwards.
