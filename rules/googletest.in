	  Google's C++ test framework sources

	  Google Test is a framework for writing C++ tests on a
	  variety of platforms. Based on the xUnit
	  architecture. Supports automatic test discovery, a rich set
	  of assertions, user-defined assertions, death tests, fatal
	  and non-fatal failures, value- and type-parameterized tests,
	  various options for running the tests, and XML test report
	  generation.

	  Google Mock is an extension of Google Test for C++ mocking.
	  Inspired by jMock, EasyMock, and Hamcrest, and designed with
	  C++'s specifics in mind, it can help you derive better
	  designs of your system and write better tests.

	  Google Mock:

	  * provides a declarative syntax for defining mocks,
	  * can easily define partial (hybrid) mocks, which are a
	    cross of real and mock objects,
	  * handles functions of arbitrary types and overloaded
	    functions,
	  * comes with a rich set of matchers for validating function
	    arguments,
	  * uses an intuitive syntax for controlling the behavior of a
	    mock,
	  * does automatic verification of expectations (no
	    record-and-replay needed),
	  * allows arbitrary (partial) ordering constraints on
	    function calls to be expressed,
	  * lets a user extend it by defining new matchers and
	    actions.
	  * does not use exceptions, and
	  * is easy to learn and use.
