	  smtpclient is a small program which can be used to send emails.
	  Unfortunately it disappeared from www.engelschall.com, so we
	  put it on the Pengutronix web server for now.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2026.03.0
	  Unmaintained in PTXdist, upstream dead and fails to build with
	  current toolchains.
