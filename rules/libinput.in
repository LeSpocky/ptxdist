	  libinput is a library to handle input devices in Wayland compositors and to
	  provide a generic X.Org input driver. It provides device detection, device
	  handling, input device event processing and abstraction so minimize the amount
	  of custom input code compositors need to provide the common set of
	  functionality that users expect.
