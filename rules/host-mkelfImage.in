	  With mkelfImage you can create elf images from kernel
	  files to be downloaded by Etherboot for LinuxBIOS.
	  Tagged images are data files, which contain the
	  necessary files for booting up (kernel+root for
	  linux, kernel+minifs for dos, ...) bundled together
	  with a special format.

	  These tagged images are downloaded and understood
	  by Etherboot and can handle LinuxBIOS restrictions
