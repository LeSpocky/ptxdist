	  libXxf86dga provides the XFree86-DGA extension,
	  which allows direct graphics access to a
	  framebuffer-like region, and also allows
	  relative mouse reporting, et al. It is mainly
	  used by games and emulators for games.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2023.12.0
	  Not really maintained any more in PTXdist. Moved with the xorg server.
	  The whole Xorg ecosystem needs updating and cleanup.
