	  filesystem client based on SSH File Transfer Protocol
	  sshfs is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer
	  Protocol. Since most SSH servers already support this protocol
	  it is very easy to set up: i.e. on the server side there`s
	  nothing to do. On the client side mounting the filesystem is as
	  easy as logging into the server with ssh.
