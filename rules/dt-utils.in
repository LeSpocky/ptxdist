	  Previous variants of the state variable set did not contain metadata.
	  The read function in the 'direct' storage backend honors this, but the
	  write function doesn't, which makes an update of the state variable
	  set impossible in this case.
	  When enabling this option, barebox-state will keep the storage in a
	  format that can be read by barebox <= v2016.08.0 when writing
	  variables into a 'direct' storage backend, or fail if this requirement
	  cannot be guaranteed.
