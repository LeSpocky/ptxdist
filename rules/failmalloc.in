	  The idea behind failmalloc is to demonstrate what really happens if
	  memory allocation fails. Refer http://www.nongnu.org/failmalloc/ for
	  further details and how to use it. This library can be used on demand
	  with the LD_PRELOAD mechanism.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2023.11.0
	  Upstream dead and fails to build with current glibc.
