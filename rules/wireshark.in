	  TShark is a network protocol analyzer.  It lets you capture packet data
	  from a live network, or read packets from a previously saved capture
	  file, either printing a decoded form of those packets to the standard
	  output or writing the packets to a file.  TShark's native capture file
	  format is libpcap format, which is also the format used by tcpdump and
	  various other tools. TShark is able to detect, read and write the same
	  capture files that are supported by Wireshark. The gtk frontend wireshark
	  can open the capture file and display the content of capture.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2026.03.0
	  Unmaintained in PTXdist and fails to build with current toolchains.
	  Needs updating to the latest version.
