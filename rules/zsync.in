	  zsync is a file transfer program. It allows you to download a
	  file from a remote server, where you have a copy of an older
	  version of the file on your computer already. zsync downloads
	  only the new parts of the file. It uses the same algorithm as
	  rsync. However, where rsync is designed for synchronising data
	  from one computer to another within an organisation, zsync is
	  designed for file distribution, with one file on a server to be
	  distributed to thousands of downloaders. zsync requires no
	  special server software - just a web server to host the files -
	  and imposes no extra load on the server, making it ideal for
	  large scale file distribution.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2026.03.0
	  Unmaintained in PTXdist, upstream dead and fails to build with
	  current toolchains.
