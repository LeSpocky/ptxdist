	  PatchELF is a simple utility for modifying existing ELF
	  executables and libraries.  In particular, it can do the
	  following:
	  * Change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter") of
            executables
	  * Change the RPATH of executables and libraries
	  * Remove declared dependencies on dynamic libraries
            (DT_NEEDED entries)
