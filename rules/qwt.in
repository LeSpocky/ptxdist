	  The Qwt library contains GUI Components and utility classes
	  which are primarily useful for programs with a technical
	  background. Beside a 2D plot widget it provides scales, sliders,
	  dials, compasses, thermometers, wheels and knobs to control or
	  display values, arrays, or ranges of type double.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2022.01.0
	  Qt4 has been replaces by Qt5 a long time ago.
