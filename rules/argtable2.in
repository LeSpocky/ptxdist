	  Argtable is an ANSI C library for parsing GNU style command line
	  arguments with a minimum of fuss. It enables the programmer to define
	  their program's argument syntax directly in the source code as an
	  array of structs. The command line is then parsed according to that
	  specification and the resulting values stored directly into
	  user-defined program variables where they are accessible to the main
	  program.
