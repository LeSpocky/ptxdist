	  libFS, the Font Services library, provides various
	  functions useful to X11 font servers, and clients
	  connecting to font servers. It is not used outside
	  of these implementations.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2023.12.0
	  Not really maintained any more in PTXdist. Moved with the xorg server.
	  The whole Xorg ecosystem needs updating and cleanup.
