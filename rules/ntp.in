config NTP_DEBUGGING
	bool
	prompt "include debugging code"
	help
	  Include a lot of debugging code.

config NTP_SLEW_ALWAYS
	bool
	prompt "always slew the time"
	help
	  Slew the clock back into line by making gradual adjustments to the
	  clock over a couple of minutes.
	  (The slew rate of typical Unix kernels is limited to 0.5 ms/s.)

config NTP_STEP_SLEW
	bool
	prompt "step and slew the time"
	help
	  Slew the clock back into line by making step adjustments to the
	  clock over a couple of minutes.

config NTP_NTPDATE_STEP
	bool
	prompt "ntpdate should step the time"
	help
	  FIXME: This item needs to be documented

config NTP_HOURLY_TODR_SYNC
	bool
	prompt "sync TODR hourly"
	help
	  If we should sync TODR hourly (the Solaris hardware clock).
	  When unsure, say no here.

config NTP_IRIG_SAWTOOTH
	bool
	prompt "enable the IRIG sawtooth filter"
	help
	  The Sun kernel driver has a sawtooth modulation with
	  amplitude over 5 ms peak-peak and period 5.5 s. The crafty
	  IRIG driver uses a transverse filter to remove the
	  modulation and something called a botttom-fisher to remove
	  incidental positive spikes especially prevalent with Sun
	  Blade 1000 and possibly other systems.

config NTP_NIST
	bool
	prompt "enable the NIST lockclock scheme"
	help
	  The NIST lockclock program synchronizes the local clock
	  via a telephone modem and the NIST Automated Computer
	  Time Service (ACTS), or the Digital Time Synchronization
	  Service (DTSS), which runs on DCE machines.

config NTP_CRYPTO
	bool
	prompt "use openssl"
	help
	  FIXME: This item needs to be documented

comment "Clock drivers"

config NTP_ALL_CLOCK_DRIVERS
	bool
	prompt "build all clock drivers"
	default y
	help
	  Disabling this entry will only build a set of selected clock drivers.
	  Else all clock drivers are included into the ntpd.

config NTP_NTPDATE
	bool
	prompt "install ntpdate"
	help
	  ntpdate sets the local date and time by polling the Network
	  Time Protocol (NTP) server(s) given as the server arguments
	  to determine the correct time.

config NTP_NTPD
	bool
	prompt "install ntpd"
	depends on !BUSYBOX_NTPD || ALLYES
	help
	  The ntpd program is an operating system daemon which sets and
	  maintains the system time of day in synchronism with Internet
	  standard time servers.

	  The ntpq utility program is used to monitor NTP daemon ntpd
	  operations and determine performance.
