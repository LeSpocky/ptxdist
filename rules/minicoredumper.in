	  The minicoredumper project provides a program that handles the
	  creation of core dump files on Linux. It can produce much smaller
	  core dump files by making use of sparse files, compression, and
	  allowing the user to configure what parts of the process memory image
	  should be dumped.

	  Note that there are currently no mechanisms integrated to
	  automatically register minicoredumper as kernel coredump helper. So
	  you might want to do

	  	echo '|/usr/sbin/minicoredumper %P %u %g %s %t %h %e' > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

	  by hand to actually make use of it.
