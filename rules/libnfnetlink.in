	  libnfnetlink is the low-level library for netfilter
	  related kernel/userspace communication. It provides a generic
	  messaging infrastructure for in-kernel netfilter subsystems
	  (such as nfnetlink_log) and their respective users and/or
	  management tools in userspace.
	  This library is not meant as a public API for application
	  developers. It is only used by other netfilter.org projects,
	  such as libnetfilter_log,
