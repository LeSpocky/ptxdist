	  The zeroMQ lightweight messaging kernel is a library which extends the
	  standard socket interfaces with features traditionally provided by
	  specialised messaging middleware products. zeroMQ sockets provide an
	  abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging patterns,
	  message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple transport
	  protocols and more.
