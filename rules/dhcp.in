	  This is the DHCP server from version 3 of the Internet Software
	  Consortium DHCP package. For more information visit the ISC web
 	  site at http://www.isc.org/.

	  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like
	  BOOTP (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of
	  BOOTPD!). It assigns IP addresses to clients based on lease
	  times.

 	  Multiple Ethernet Interfaces are supported by this DHCP package.

	help
	  This is the main component of the DHCP server, the daemon process
	  that allows a server to provide a Dynamic Host Configuration
	  Protocol service to a network.
	  It takes its configuration from /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf and tracks
	  issued addresses as records in the dhcpd.leases file.

config DHCP_CLIENT
	bool
	prompt "DHCP Client dhclient"
	help
	  This is a client process to provide the system it runs on
	  with an IP address. It also handles a lease refresh if it
	  expires.

config DHCP_RELAY
	bool
	prompt "DHCP Relay dhcrelay"
	help
	  The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Relay Agent, dhcrelay, provides a
	  means for relaying DHCP and BOOTP requests from a subnet to which no
	  DHCP server is directly connected to one or more DHCP servers on other
	  subnets.

	  The DHCP Relay Agent listens for DHCP and BOOTP queries and responses.
	  When a query is received from a client, dhcrelay forwards it to the
	  list of DHCP servers specified on the command line. When a reply is
	  received from a server, it is broadcast or unicast (according to the
	  relay agent's ability or the client's request) on the network from
	  which the original request came.
