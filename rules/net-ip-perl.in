	  Net::IP provides functions to deal with IPv4/IPv6 addresses.
	  The module can be used as a class, allowing the user to instantiate IP
	  objects, which can be single IP addresses, prefixes, or ranges of addresses.
	  There is also a procedural way of accessing most of the functions. Most
	  subroutines can take either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses transparently.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2025.06.0
	  Moved to staging with perl.
