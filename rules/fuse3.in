	  Filesystem in Userspace (3.x version)
	  Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a simple interface for
	  userspace programs to export a virtual filesystem to the Linux
	  kernel. It also aims to provide a secure method for non
	  privileged users to create and mount their own filesystem
	  implementations.
