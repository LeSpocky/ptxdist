	  bc is an arbitrary precision numeric processing language. Syntax is
	  similar to C, but differs in many substantial areas. It supports
	  interactive execution of statements. bc is a utility included in the
	  POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft standard.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2026.03.0
	  Unmaintained in PTXdist, fails to build with current toolchains.
	  Needs updating to the latest version.
