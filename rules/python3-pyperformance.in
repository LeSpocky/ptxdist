	  Pyperformance creates a venv and installs all required packages.
	  However for some architectures, this is not possible, because no
	  wheels are provided for download and a compiler is needed on the
	  target to build the package.
	  To work around this, install these package via PTXdist and hack
	  the requirements.txt files to use the versions provided by
	  PTXdist.
