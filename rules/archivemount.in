	  Archivemount is a piece of glue code between libarchive and FUSE.
	  It can be used to mount a (possibly compressed) archive (as
	  in .tar.gz or .tar.bz2) and use it like an ordinary filesystem.

	  It is a user-space application setting up the mount.
	  Usage: archivemount <archivepath> <mountpoint> [options]
	  See "archivemount --help" for more information.

	  To umount, use "fusermount -u" from FUSE utils.
