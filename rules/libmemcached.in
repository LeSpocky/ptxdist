	  libmemcached is a C client library for interfacing to a memcached
	  server. It has been designed to be light on memory usage, thread
	  safe and to provide full access to server side methods. It also
	  implements several command line tools: memcat, memflush, memrm,
	  memstat, and memslap (for load generation). The library has been
	  designed to allow for different hashing methods on keys,
	  partitioning by keys, and to use consistent hashing for
	  distribution.
	  You can find more information here: http://tangent.org/552/libmemcached.html
