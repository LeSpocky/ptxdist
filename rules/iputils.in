	help
	  ping uses the ICMP protocols mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit
	  an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.
	  It works with both IPv4 and IPv6. Using only one of them explicitly can
	  be enforced by specifying -4 or -6.

config IPUTILS_RARPD
	bool

	help
	  Listens RARP (http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc903.txt) requests from
	  clients. Provided MAC address of client is found in /etc/ethers
	  database and obtained host name is resolvable to an IP address
	  appropriate for attached network, rarpd answers to client with
	  RARPD reply carrying an IP address.

config IPUTILS_RDISC
	bool

	help
	  The rdisc command implements client side of the ICMP router discover
	  protocol. rdisc is invoked at boot time to populate the network
	  routing tables with default routes.

config IPUTILS_TRACEPATH
	bool
	prompt "tracepath"
	help
	  tracepath traces the path to a network host discovering the MTU along
	  this path. Because it uses UDP for tracing, it does not need superuser
	  privileges like traceroute6. tracepath works for both IPv4 and IPv6.

config IPUTILS_TRACEROUTE6
	bool
	select IPUTILS_LIBCAP
	depends on !BUSYBOX_TRACEROUTE6 || ALLYES

	help
	  traceroute6 tracks the route packets take from an IP network on their
	  way to a given host. Supports UDP, ICMP and TCP for tracing and works
	  for IPv6 only.
