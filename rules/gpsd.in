	  gpsd is a daemon that listens to a GPS or Loran receiver
	  and translates the positional data into a simplified format
	  that can be more easily used by other programs, like chart plotters.
	  The package comes with a sample client that plots the location
	  of the currently visible GPS satellites (if available)
	  and a speedometer. It can also use DGPS/ip.

	config GPSD_GPSD
		bool
		prompt "gpsd"
		help
		  gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more
		  GPS- or AIS receivers attached through serial or USB
		  ports, making all data on the location/course/velocity
		  of the sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947
		  of the host. With gpsd, multiple location-aware client
		  applications can share access to receivers without
		  contention or loss of data. Also, gpsd responds to
		  queries with a format that is substantially easier to
		  parse than the NMEA 0183 emitted by most GPS receivers.

	config GPSD_GPSDCTL
		bool

	config GPSD_GPSCTL
		bool
		prompt "gpsctl"
		help
		  The gpsctl tool for tweaking GPS settings.
		  gpsctl can switch a dual-mode GPS between NMEA and
		  vendor-binary modes. It can also be used to set the
		  device baudrate. Note: Not all devices have these
		  capabilities.

	config GPSD_GPSDECODE
		bool
		prompt "gpsdecode"
		depends on GPSD_DRIVER_RTCM104V2

		  differential-correction services.

	config GPSD_GPSPIPE
		bool
		prompt "gpspipe"
		help
		  A simple client that captures GPS output and/or gpsd
		  reports and sends it to standard output.
		  gpspipe is a tool to connect to gpsd and output the
		  received sentences to stdout. This makes the program
		  useful as a pipe from gpsd to another program or file.

		bool

		prompt "gpsmon"
		help
		  The gpsmon real-time packet monitor and diagnostic tool.
		  (This replaces the sirfmon tool in older versions.)
		  gpsmon is a monitor that watches packets coming from a
		  GPS and displays them along with diagnostic information.
		  It supports commands that can be used to tweak GPS settings
		  in various ways; some are device-independent, some vary
		  with the GPS chipset type.

	config GPSD_NTPSHMMON
		bool

		prompt "ntpshmmon"
		help
		  Capture samples from GPS or other ntpd refclock sources.
		  This program monitors the shared-memory segments updated by
		  gpsd (and possibly other refclock sources) as a way of
		  communicating with ntpd, the Network Time Protocol daemon.
		  It reads these in exactly the way an ntpd instance does.
		  It can be run concurrently with ntpd without interfering with
		  ntpd's normal operation.

		  or serial device (presumed to have a GPS attached) and
		  reports to standard output.

	config GPSD_GPSFAKE
		bool
		select GPSD_PYTHON
		prompt "gpsfake"
		help
		  The gpsfake test harness simulating a GPS receiver.
		  gpsfake is a test harness for gpsd and its clients. It
		  opens a pty (pseudo-TTY), launches a gpsd instance that
		  thinks the slave side of the pty is its GPS device, and
		  repeatedly feeds the contents of one or more test logfiles
		  through the master side to the GPS.

	config GPSD_GPSPROF
		bool
		select GPSD_PYTHON
		prompt "gpsprof"
		help
		  The gpsprof program for plotting spatial scatter of fixes
		  and fix latency.
		  gpsprof measures the various latencies between a GPS and
		  its client. It emits to standard output a GNUPLOT program
		  that draws an illustrative graph. It can also be told to
		  emit the raw profile data.
