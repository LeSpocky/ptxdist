	  liburcu is an LGPLv2.1 userspace RCU (read-copy-update) library. This
	  data synchronization library provides read-side access which scales
	  linearly with the number of cores. It does so by allowing multiples
	  copies of a given data structure to live at the same time, and by
	  monitoring the data structure accesses to detect grace periods after
	  which memory reclamation is possible.

	default y
	help
	  Provide SMP support. Warning: Disable this only on real uniprocessor
	  systems.
