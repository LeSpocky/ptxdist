	  PowerTOP is a Linux tool that finds the software
	  component(s) that make your laptop use more power than
	  necessary while it is idle. As of Linux kernel version
	  2.6.21, the kernel no longer has a fixed 1000Hz timer
	  tick. This will (in theory) give a huge power savings
	  because the CPU stays in low power mode for longer periods
	  of time during system idle.

	  However... there are many things that can ruin the party,
	  both inside the kernel and in userspace. PowerTOP combines
	  various sources of information from the kernel into one
	  convenient screen so that you can see how well your system
	  is doing, and which components are the biggest problem.

	help
	  This adds powertop support for the PCI bus. Should only be
	  enabled if you have PCI support.
