	  Extended crypt library for descrypt, md5crypt, bcrypt, and others.

	  libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords.
	  It supports a wide variety of both modern and historical hashing
	  methods: yescrypt, gost-yescrypt, scrypt, bcrypt, sha512crypt,
	  sha256crypt, md5crypt, SunMD5, sha1crypt, NT, bsdicrypt, bigcrypt,
	  and descrypt.  It provides the traditional Unix crypt and crypt_r
	  interfaces, as well as a set of extended interfaces pioneered by
	  Openwall Linux, crypt_rn, crypt_ra, crypt_gensalt,
	  crypt_gensalt_rn, and crypt_gensalt_ra.

	  libxcrypt is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other
	  similar programs; that is, to hash a small number of passwords
	  during an interactive authentication dialogue with a human.  It is
	  not suitable for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in
	  any other situation where speed is more important than careful
	  handling of sensitive data.  However, it is intended to be fast and
	  lightweight enough for use in servers that must field thousands of
	  login attempts per minute.

config LIBXCRYPT_OBSOLETE_STUBS
	bool
	prompt "Replace obsolete functions with non-functional stubs"
	help
	  If enabled, this option replaces the obsolete APIs (fcrypt,
	  encrypt{,_r}, and setkey{,_r}) with stubs that set errno to
	  ENOSYS and return without performing any real operations.

	  For security reasons, the encrypt{,r} functions will also
	  overwrite their data-block argument with random bits.

	  The fcrypt function will also always return NULL-pointer.
