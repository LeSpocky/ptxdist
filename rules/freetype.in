	  The FreeType project is a team of volunteers who develop free,
	  portable and high-quality software solutions for digital typography.
	  They specifically target embedded systems and focus on bringing small,
	  efficient and ubiquitous products.
	  The FreeType library is their software font engine. In version 1 this
	  library only supports true type fonts, since version 2 it supports all
	  types of scalable fonts. If you intent to use this library in an X
	  environment, its only needed on client side, not on server side.
