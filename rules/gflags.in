	  The gflags library implements commandline flags processing. As such it's
	  a replacement for getopt(). It has increased flexibility, including
	  built-in support for C++ types like string, and the ability to define
	  flags in the source file in which they're used.

	  See https://code.google.com/p/gflags/ for info about it.
