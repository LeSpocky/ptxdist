	  Tool to extract oopses generated with mtd-oops.ko driver.

	  To use that mechanism, just select CONFIG_MTD_OOPS in the kernel
	  configuration and add 'mtdoops.mtddev=<devno>' to your boot command
	  line where '<devno>' is the MTD device number you want to use to save
	  kernel oopses. Alternatively, load the 'mtdoops' module with
	  'mtddev=<devno>' as module parameter. To extract that oops, just use
	  'sp-oops-extract /dev/mtd<devno>'.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2026.06.0
	  Unmaintained in PTXdist, upstream dead and download is gone.
