	  sshpass is a tool for non-interactively performing password
	  authentication with SSH's so called "interactive keyboard
	  password authentication".
	  Most user should use SSH's more secure public key
	  authentication instead.

	  SECURITY NOTE: There is a reason OpenSSH insists that
	  passwords be typed interactively.
	  Passwords are harder to store securely and to pass around
	  securely between programs.
	  If you have not looked into solving your needs using SSH's
	  "public key authentication", perhaps in conjunction with the
	  ssh agent (RTFM ssh-add), please do so before being tempted
	  into using this package.
