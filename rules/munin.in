	  Munin is a networked resource monitoring tool that can help
	  analyze resource trends and "what just happened to kill our
	  performance?" problems. It is designed to be very plug and play.
	  A default installation provides a lot of graphs with almost no
	  work.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2025.06.0
	  Moved to staging with perl.
