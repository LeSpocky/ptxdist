	  pslib is a C-library to create PostScript files on the fly. It
	  offers many drawing primitives, inclusion of png and eps images
	  and a very sophisticated text rendering including hyphenation,
	  kerning and ligatures. It can read external Type1 fonts and embed
	  them into the output file. It supports pdfmarks which makes it in
	  combination with ghostscript`s pdfwriter an alternative for
	  libraries creating PDF.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2026.03.0
	  Unmaintained in PTXdist and fails to build with current toolchains.
	  Needs updating to the latest version.
