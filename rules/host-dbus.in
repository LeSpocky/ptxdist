	  D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way
	  for applications to talk to one another. In
	  addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus
	  helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes
	  it simple and reliable to code a "single
	  instance" application or daemon, and to launch
	  applications and daemons on demand when their
	  services are needed.
