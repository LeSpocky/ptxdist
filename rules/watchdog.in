	  A software watchdog

	  The watchdog program writes to /dev/watchdog every ten
	  seconds.  If the device is opened but not written to within
	  a minute, the machine will reboot. This feature is available
	  when the kernel is built with 'software watchdog' support.

	  The ability to reboot will depend on the state of the
	  machine and interrupts.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2022.01.0
	  Fails to build with gcc 10.
