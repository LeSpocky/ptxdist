	  Full screen ncurses traceroute tool

	  mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and
	  'ping' programs in a single network diagnostic tool.

	  As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection
	  between the host mtr runs on and a user-specified
	  destination host. After it determines the address of each
	  network hop between the machines, it sends a sequence ICMP
	  ECHO requests to each one to determine the quality of the
	  link to each machine. As it does this, it prints running
	  statistics about each machine.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2023.04.0
	  Not realy maintained in PTXdist and fails to build with a current
	  toolchain (gcc 11).
