	  fscryptctl is a low-level tool that handles raw keys and manages
	  policies for the Linux filesystem encryption, specifically the
	  "fscrypt" kernel interface which is supported by the ext4,
	  f2fs, and UBIFS filesystems.

	  fscryptctl is mainly intended for embedded systems which can't use the
	  full-featured fscrypt tool. It does *not* handle key generation,
	  key stretching, key wrapping, or PAM integration.
