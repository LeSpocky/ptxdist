	  Tcpdump prints out the headers of packets on a network interface
	  that match the boolean expression. It can also be run with
	  the -w flag, which causes it to save the packet data to a file
	  for later analysis, and/or with the -r flag, which causes it to
	  read from a saved packet file rather than to read  packets from
	  a network interface. In all cases, only packets that match
	  expression will be processed by tcpdump.

config TCPDUMP_ENABLE_LIBCAP_NG
	bool
	prompt "enable libcap-ng support"
	help
	  Use libcap-ng (POSIX capabilities) in tcpdump.
	  It allows tcpdump to shift uid/gid and chroot to
	  operate in a non-privileged mode instead of using root.

config TCPDUMP_ENABLE_CRYPTO
	bool
	prompt "enable crypto support"
	help
	  Select this if you need support for decoding various
	  protocols in relation to encryption (f.ex. IPsec packets)

config TCPDUMP_SMB
	bool
	prompt "enable SMB-printer decoding support"
	default y
	help
	  Select this if need support for decoding packets
	  in relation to SMB/CIFS (printers).
	  Still considered buggy.
