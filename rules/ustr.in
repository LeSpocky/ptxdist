	  ustr (Micro string library) is a string API for C. It has tiny overhead over
	  just plain strdup(), is much safer, is easier to use, is faster for many
	  operations, can be used with read-only or automatically allocated data.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2021.07.0
	  No new versions since 2008, and fails to download.
