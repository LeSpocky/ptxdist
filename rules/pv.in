	  pv (Pipe Viewer) is a terminal-based tool for monitoring the progress
	  of data through a pipeline. It can be inserted into any normal
	  pipeline between two processes to give a visual indication of how
	  quickly data is passing through, how long it has taken, how near to
	  completion it is, and an estimate of how long it will be until
	  completion.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2026.03.0
	  Unmaintained in PTXdist, fails to build with current toolchains.
	  Needs updating to the latest version.
