	  libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard C++. It
	  allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to any
	  callback function, either global or a member function, regardless of
	  whether it is static or virtual.

	  It also contains adaptor classes for connection of dissimilar callbacks
	  and has an ease of use unmatched by other C++ callback libraries.
	  Libsigc++ is licensed under the GNU Library General Public License,
	  LGPL.

	  STAGING: remove in PTXdist 2025.07.0
	  Unmaintained in ptxdist and fails to build with gcc 14. Needs updating
	  to a new version.
