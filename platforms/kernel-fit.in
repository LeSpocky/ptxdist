	  Generate a FIT image from the kernel image.
	  This will contain the kernel image and all device trees in
	  PTXCONF_KERNEL_DTS.
	  Configurations are provided for each device tree together with
	  the kernel image.

	help
	  Use 'kernel_noload' as sub-image type for the kernel, setting
	  the load address and entry address to dummy values as required
	  by the FIT image specification.
	  Useful for booting kernels supporting multiple boards with
	  U-Boot, e.g. the platform-v7a kernel of DistroKit.
	  U-Boot supports this since release v2011.12.

	  Note: barebox added support with release v2024.01.0.
	  You can leave this option disabled if you only use barebox.
	  You should not enable this if you use older barebox versions.
