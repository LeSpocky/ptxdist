	  The AT91Bootstrap application is a first level bootloader
	  for Atmel AT91SAM9 ARM Thumb-based microcontrollers.
	  It is used for booting these microcontrollers from SPI dataflash
	  or NAND-flash.

	  For example, using this bootstrap, it is possible to
	  obtain a basic bootloader that is located in DataFlash and is
	  copied to internal SRAM by SAM-BA Boot (internal bootROM). The
	  bootloader performs the processor initialization (PLLs, PIOs,
	  SDRAMC, SPI), loads UBoot from DataFlash sectors to SDRAM and
	  then jumps to it.

	  It is required for these microcontrollers, because the bootROM of some
	  of these cores can only handle a miximum of 4kB of the 1st stage
	  bootloader (e.g. SRAM limits). U-boot is usually much larger
	  than this.

	  U-boot is normally build with the options CONFIG_SKIP_LOWLEVEL_INIT
	  and CONFIG_SKIP_RELOCATE_UBOOT

	  AT91Bootstrap integrates several sets of algorithms:
	  - Device initialization such as clock speed configuration, PIO settings, etc.
	  - Peripheral drivers such as PIO, PMC, SDRAMC, etc.
	  - Physical media algorithms such as DataFlash, NANDFlash, Parallel Flash, etc.
