	  This generates a RAUC update bundle for the selected platform using
	  genimage.

	  By default, this will create a simple bundle for updating a 'rootfs'
	  slot with the content from PTXdist's root file system .tgz image.

	  To customize the bundle, copy and adapt the genimage configuration
	  in configs/images/rauc.config.

	  Include intermediate certificates in the bundle signature that
	  can be used to close the trust chain during bundle signature
	  verification. The certificates must be stored in the CA of the
	  "update-intermediate" role of the code signing provider.

config IMAGE_RAUC_HOOK

	help
	  If you enable this option and create a file named
	  config/images/rauc-hooks.sh in any PTXDIST_PATH component, it will be
	  included in the bundle and declared as a hook script in the manifest.
	  Note that you still need to define the respective install or slot
	  hooks in the manifest so that RAUC calls them.
