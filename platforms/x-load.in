	prompt "OMAP x-load                   "
	help
	  The X-Loader is a first level bootloader for Texas Instruments OMAP
	  microprocessors (similar to the AT91Bootstrap application). It is
	  used for booting these microprocessors from NAND-flash, MMC/SD-card,
	  USB or serial interfaces.

if X_LOAD

config X_LOAD_VERSION
	string
	default "f243938"
	prompt "x-loader version"
	help
	  Enter the X-Loader version you want to build. Usually something like "1.4.2"

	  NOTICE: The X-Loader source tree was never released as download archive.
	  As long as that fact exists you can use the archived tarballs at:

	    http://www.ptxdist.org/software/ptxdist/temporary-src/

	  or have to store a local tarball inside your ptxdist project root at:

	    ${PTXDIST_WORKSPACE}/local_src/

config X_LOAD_MD5
	prompt "x-loader source md5sum"
	string

config X_LOAD_CONFIG
	string
	prompt "x-loader config target"
	help
	  The X-Loader make config target. Usually something like
	  "yourbox_config". See X-Loader's main Makefile for possible
	  configuration targets.

config X_LOAD_MAKE_IFT
	bool
	prompt "generate signed ift file"
	help
	  When this option is enabled, a so-called IFT file is generated. You
	  need a X-Loader source tree that supports this. This must know about
	  the make target 'ift' so ptxdist can do the following: "make ift".

	  In details you will need the tool signGP from
	  http://beagleboard.googlecode.com/files/signGP.c
