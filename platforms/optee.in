	  OP-TEE is an open source project which contains a full implementation
	  to make up a complete Trusted Execution Environment. The project has
	  roots in a proprietary solution, initially created by ST-Ericsson and
	  then owned and maintained by STMicroelectronics. In 2014, Linaro
	  started working with STMicroelectronics to transform the proprietary
	  TEE solution into an open source TEE solution instead.

	  platforms.

config OPTEE_INSTALL_USER_TAS
	bool "install in-tree user TAs"
	help
	  Install the OP-TEE in-tree user TAs.

	  Enable this option to install the user TAs, which are included in
	  the OP-TEE OS, into the rootfs. This allows loading the TAs via the
	  tee-supplicant at runtime and removes the requirement to include the
	  TAs as early TAs in the OP-TEE binary.
