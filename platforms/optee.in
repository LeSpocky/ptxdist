	  OP-TEE is an open source project which contains a full implementation
	  to make up a complete Trusted Execution Environment. The project has
	  roots in a proprietary solution, initially created by ST-Ericsson and
	  then owned and maintained by STMicroelectronics. In 2014, Linaro
	  started working with STMicroelectronics to transform the proprietary
	  TEE solution into an open source TEE solution instead.
