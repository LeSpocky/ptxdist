config BOARDSETUP_SERVERIP
	string
	prompt "server IP address"
	help
	  Specify your target board's server IP address here.

config BOARDSETUP_TARGETIP
	string
	prompt "target IP address"
	help
	  Specify your target board's IP address here.

config BOARDSETUP_GATEWAY
	string
	prompt "gateway IP"
	help
	  Specify your target board's gateway IP address here.

config BOARDSETUP_NETMASK
	string
	prompt "netmask"
	help
	  Specify your target board's netmask here.

config BOARDSETUP_NFSROOT_PATH
	string
	prompt "nfsroot path"
	default "${PTXDIST_PLATFORMDIR}/root"
	help
	  Specify path where the target should mount its rootpath via nfs. If you
	  have built a BSP, a reasonalbe value for this field might be the path to
	  the root/ directory under the location of your BSP. Ensure that the
	  above given path is exported by nfs server. This field will be ignored
	  if you don't use nfsroot.

config BOARDSETUP_NFSROOT_CLIENT_SPECIFICATIONS
	string
	prompt "nfsroot client specifications"
	default "(rw,no_root_squash)"
	help
	  Specify the list of client specifications for the nfsroot export.
	  Example: "1.2.3.4(rw) 192.168.2.0/24(ro,all_squash)"

	  Clients can be specified using either a hostname, an IP address, or an IP
	  network. Networks can be given by specifying the number of leading 1 bits
	  in the netmask or by giving the full netmask. If the hostname is empty, the
	  directory is exported to everyone.

	  Options can follow a client specification and have to be enclosed in
	  parenthesis, with the opening paren directly following the client name or
	  address. If no options are given, ro and root_squash are enabled by default.

config BOARDSETUP_TFTP_PATH
	string
	prompt "tftp path"
	default "/tftpboot"
	help
	  Specify path where the target can fetch files via TFTP. Mostly this is
	  /tftpboot so the default can be used, but it depends on the host
	  distribution. The image file for the rootfs will be copied into this
	  directory prior flashing the target. Ensure write permissions into this
	  directory.

config BOARDSETUP_ETH_INTERFACE
	string
	prompt "ethernet interface (for tap devices only)"
	default "labnet1"
	help
	  If running virtual hardware (simulated by qemu/kvm), qemu needs to know
	  about a tap interface for virtual networking. Specify it here.

config BOARDSETUP_NFSPORT
	int
	prompt "NFS service port"
	default 2049
	help
	  When exporting the rootfs with unfsd, this port will be used as NFS
	  service and MOUNT service port

	default "/dev/ttyS0"
	help
	  Specify host's serial port for target connection.
	  You can also use a rfc2217-connection (comport-over-telnet). Simply
	  enter 'host:port'.

	prompt "serial baud rate"
	default "115200"
