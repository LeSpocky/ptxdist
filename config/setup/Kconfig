	help
	  Specify the path to your Java SDK; this is needed if Java
	  programs are being compiled by PTXdist, for example
	  if you have selected JVisu.
	  This must not be '/usr' but the actual SDK path,
	  e.g. '/usr/lib/jvm/default-java'.
	  Make sure the selected directory contains bin/javac.

endmenu

menu "Developer Options "

config SETUP_DISABLE_LOCAL_CHECK
	bool
	prompt "disable local disk check"
	help
	  By default ptxdist will check that the BSP is built on a
	  local disk. Building on a network file system is slow and
	  may fail under certain circumstances.
	  Disable this check at your own risk.

config SETUP_DISABLE_REPRODUCIBLE
	bool
	prompt "disable reproducible builds"
	help
	  PTXdist tries to make building as reproducible as possible.
	  This includes fixed user names and especially timestamps by
	  setting SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH and similar variables.

	  This can be confusing during development. E.g. The Linux kernel
	  build timestamp never changes and cannot be used to ensure that
	  the correct kernel image is used.
	  Enable this option to get a new timestamp for every PTXdist call.

config SETUP_ENV_WHITELIST
	string "environment variable whitelist (space separated)"
	help
	  PTXdist clears the environment by default. Specify a space
	  separated list of environment variables to preserve here.


config SETUP_COMMON_CACHE
	bool "use common configure cache"
	help
	  Use only one configure cache file for host and for target
	  packages, instead of a cache for each programm. This can
	  speed up compilation, but may breaks things badly.

	  This is a developer option, you probably don't want to
	  enable this.


config SETUP_GEN_DEP_TREE
	bool "generate dependency graphs"
	help
	  PTXdist has the feature to generate graphs to illustrate the
	  dependencies to build a root file system. This information
	  is probably only interesting for hard core developers or
	  marketing guys, you probably don't want it.

	  BTW: you need to install the 'dot' program of the
	       'graphviz' package for this.


config SETUP_CHECK_EXIT_ON_ERROR
	bool "enable exit on error"
	help
	  Use bash's "set -e" feature within ptxdist which enables
	  quite aggressive error checking. Don't turn this on until
	  you know what you're doing.

config SETUP_ICECC
	bool "use icecc"
	depends on !SETUP_CCACHE
	help
	  icecc (also known as Icecream) is a distributed compile system.
	  It allows parallel compiling by distributing the compile jobs to
	  several nodes of a compile network running the icecc daemon. The
	  icecc scheduler routes the jobs and provides status and
	  statistics information to the icecc monitor.

if SETUP_ICECC

config SETUP_ICECC_CREATE_ENV
	string
	default "/usr/lib/icecc/icecc-create-env"
	prompt "icecc-create-env path"
	help
	  The full path to icecc-create-env.

endif

config SETUP_CCACHE
	bool "use ccache"
	help
	  ccache is a compiler cache. It speeds up re-compilation of
	  C/C++ code by caching previous compiles and detecting when
	  the same compile is being done again.


config SETUP_PATCHIN_GIT
	bool "use git to apply patches"
	help

	  Activating this option, ptxdist will use "git" instead of
	  quilt to apply patches.

	  _NOTE_: this is an experimental feature

config SETUP_NFS_REL_SYMLINK
	bool "make absolute symlinks relative on nfsroot"
	help
	  With this option enabled, ptxdist converts any absolute
	  symlink into a relative symlink when installing it to
	  ${PLATFORMDIR}/root{,-debug}. This makes it easier to check
	  for broken links.
	  The link installed into the image remains absolute.

config SETUP_NFS_VIRTFS
	bool "provide ownership/permission metadata in the nfsroot"
	help
	  With this option enabled, ptxdist will store the ownership,
	  permission and special file information in files in
	  .virtfs_metadata/ subdirectories.
	  This can be used by qemu with the 9p filesystem and
	  'security_model=mapped-file' to provide the correct permissions
	  etc. for the guest system.
	  The NFS server run by 'ptxdist nfsroot' will also use this data.

config SETUP_DIRECT_CLEAN
	bool "ptxdist clean without check"
	help
	  I'm a developer. I know what I'm doing. Just clean the BSP.

config SETUP_AUTO_EXTRACT
	bool "automatically reextract non-git sources"
	help
	  By default ptxdist will refuse to delete the existing package
	  source tree if the extract stage is triggered again due to
	  dependencies (e.g. new patches). This happens to ensure that
	  local changes are not accidentally lost.
	  If this option is enabled, then the sources are automatically
	  deleted unless they contain a .git directory. This is useful if
	  local modifications are only done in combination with --git.

config SETUP_HOST_CPP
	prompt "host CPP"
	string
	default "cpp"
	help
	  Specify the host preprocessor here.

config SETUP_HOST_CC
	prompt "host CC"
	string
	default "gcc"
	help
	  Specify the host C compile here.

config SETUP_HOST_CXX
	prompt "host CXX"
	string
	default "g++"
	help
	  Specify the host C++ compile here.

config SETUP_HOST_MAKE
	prompt "host MAKE"
	string
	default "make"
	help
	  Specify the host make programm here.
