PTXdist
=======

Installation
------------

To install PTXdist, just run

	./configure --prefix=<installpath>

to configure the packet, then

	make

to build everything and

	make install

to install it. When you start using PTXdist, make sure your $PATH
environment variable points to <installpath>/bin, because that's where
the PTXdist frontend program is being installed to.

For developers who want to work with git versions of PTXdist it is only
necessary to run "./autogen.sh && ./configure && make" and set the PATH
variable to the bin/ directory inside the PTXdist tree.

Idea
----

PTXdist is a build system which can be used to generate a root tree and
disk images for all kinds of Linux systems. It was written with embedded
systems in mind, but there is no reason why you can't use it to
configure your firewall, router or whatever dedicated "device" comes to
your mind.

The job works like this: you run 'ptxdist menuconfig' and
'ptxdist platformconfig', configure what you need. Run 'ptxdist images'
and you'll find a root tree in ./platform-<name>/root/, and disk images
in ./platform-<name>/images/. Voil√†.

All magic necessary to do these things in a cross enviroment are written
into "recipes", living in rules/*.make, and config menues in
rules/*.in.
