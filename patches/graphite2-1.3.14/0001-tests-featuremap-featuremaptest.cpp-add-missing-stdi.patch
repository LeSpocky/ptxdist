Subject: [PATCH] tests/featuremap/featuremaptest.cpp: add missing <stdint.h>
 include

Without the change `graphite` build fails on upcoming `gcc-15` as:

    tests/featuremap/featuremaptest.cpp:30:15: error: 'uint8_t' was not declared in this scope
       30 |   std::vector<uint8_t> _ttf;
          |               ^~~~~~~
    tests/featuremap/featuremaptest.cpp:16:1: note: 'uint8_t' is defined in header '<cstdint>';
      this is probably fixable by adding '#include <cstdint>'
       15 | #include "inc/Face.h"
      +++ |+#include <cstdint>
       16 | #include "inc/FeatureMap.h"
