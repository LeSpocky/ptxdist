Subject: [PATCH] wayland-info: Fix build without libdrm

wayland-info can optionally use libdrm to provide a description of the
dmabuf format modifiers.

When not using libdrm however, the build fails because "dev_t" is not
defined.

The definition of "dev_t" comes from <sys/types.h> which is included
from <libdrm.h>, which is not included without libdrm support, hence the
build failure.

Simply include <sys/types.h> unconditionally to make sure "dev_t" is
defined regardless of libdrm support, to fix the build failure.

Closes: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-utils/-/issues/6
