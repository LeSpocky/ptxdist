Subject: [PATCH] Revert "Default to AdminIdentities=unix-group:wheel for local
 authority"

This reverts commit 763faf434b445c20ae9529100d3ef5290976d0c9.

On Red Hat derivatives, every member of group 'wheel' is necessarily
privileged. On Debian derivatives, there is no wheel group, and gid 0
(root) is not used in this way. Change the default rule to consider
uid 0 to be privileged, instead.

On Red Hat derivatives, 50-default.rules is not preserved by upgrades;
on dpkg-based systems, it is a proper conffile and may be edited
(at the sysadmin's own risk), so the comment about not editing it is
misleading.

[smcv: added longer explanation of why we make this change;
remove unrelated cosmetic change to a man page]

Forwarded: no, Debian-specific
